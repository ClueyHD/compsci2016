They have a kind of scruffy grey feathering which i guess indicates their youth but they look pretty full grown shape wise. They dont look entirely new. id say they've been around for a while but i have just not timed my visits for when they're in sight. the population of this family goes up to 4. The babies and parent (mother) were pecking through the grass foliage around the base o the tree near my stairway, stairway 10. They looked very sure of their surroundings, not frightened by my presence until i approached. They made a poor effort to hop further from me but the parent didnt seem to care. i expected to be swooped or something. ",Feeding,Yes,Urban

Sited in the eucalyptus tree above and beside the bike cage on residence, next to the car park for Richardson hall. I made an exciting discovery as i think there is a nest, i often see 2, and sometimes 1, suggesting the female may be incubating eggs. The top of the tree displays thick foliage and so i am yet to spot one yet. This afternoon after walking back from class and putting my bike away i could see one bird, but hear 2 calls. They were warbling loudly. one of them dropped down to the base of the tree quickly to look around, maybe for food. but flew back up to the tree after a few minutes. It looked healthy. It did not find any food whilst on the ground. ",Calling,No,Near a road

There is another young one but  they are not attacking it. The Attacked fledgling comes into our yard and calls for help!! if that makes sense. We have 3 water bowls and this young bird uses them daily, it also spends time on its own in our yard perhaps setting up a mini territory of its own. This is suburban Sandringham in Melbourne and there are literally Magpie territories  every couple of blocks. I have never known the numbers to be so high. Sometimes during March to July there would be up to 10 birds in 2 family groups  having territory wars on our intersection.",,,
